\doxysection{Introduction}\label{index_intro}
This documentation provides an overview of the Akari DAP project, inspired by the Akari logic puzzle. The objective of the game is to illuminate all cells on the grid without lighting those containing light bulbs. The project is backed by Maven, a project management tool that simplifies building and dependency management.\doxysection{Continuous Integration}\label{index_ci}
Continuous integration has been achieved through Jenkins and Circle\+CI, ensuring an efficient and reliable development flow. Sonar\+Cloud has been implemented for static code analysis, enhancing code quality and detecting potential issues. Unit tests have been developed with JUnit to ensure the robustness and reliability of the code.\doxysection{Technologies and Practices}\label{index_tech}
Developed in Java, this project leverages modern technologies and practices to deliver a solid and maintainable implementation of the Akari game. Maven streamlines project management, while Jenkins, Circle\+CI, and Sonar\+Cloud contribute to a comprehensive and high-\/quality development process.
